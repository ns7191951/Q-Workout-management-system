    <h3 class="card-title"> Press up</h3><br>
    <p class="card-text"><b>How to do it:</b> Get down into a press-up position with your hands placed shoulder-width apart and back flat, so a straight line forms from your head to heels, via your glutes. Lower your body until your chest is an inch from the ground then explosively drive up by fully extending your arms. That's on rep.<br><br>

<b>Why:</b> This move uses multiple muscle groups for maximum growth and strengthens your shoulder joints. Easily done as an exercise at home, this prepares you for progression to the more demanding shoulder exercises you'll face in a gym, like the incline bench press.</p>

    <h3 class="card-title"> Burpees</h3><br>
    <p class="card-text"><b>How to do it:</b> From a standing position squat down until your thighs are parallel to the floor and place your palms on the floor. From there kick your feet back as far as you can while keeping your arms extended. As soon as your feet land jump them back in towards your hands, then jump up into the air. Land and immediately squat down to go into the next rep.<br><br>

<b>Why:</b> When it comes to burning fat at home, few moves can do better then the burpee. Perfect for frying fat with zero equipment, work these into your home workout routine to ramp up your heart rate or set yourself daily challenges.</p>

    <h3 class="card-title"> Jumping lunges</h3><br>
    <p class="card-text"><b>How to do it:</b> Lunge forward until your rear knee is almost touching the ground. Jump into the air, bringing your rear foot forward and the front foot back. Land in a lunge and repeat. Land on both feet simultaneously to cushion the impact on your joints.<br><br>

<b>Why:</b> Just like burpees, these are perfect for building up your cardiovascular system, but will also help you build faster, more powerful quadriceps. Ideal if your leg day has taken a hit.</p>

    <h3 class="card-title"> Spiderman Press up</h3><br>
    <p class="card-text"><b>How to do it:</b> Get into a traditional press-up position. Lower yourself toward the floor and bring your right knee to your right elbow, keeping it off the ground. Press back up and return your leg to the starting position. Repeat with the alternate leg.<br><br>

<b>Why:</b> Perfect if you're looking to get some mobility in before a workout or just want to switch up your chest routine, Spiderman press-ups are the perfect alternative if you're looking to scale things up.</p>

  <div class="card-body">
    <h3 class="card-title"> Plank</h3><br>
    <p class="card-text"><b>How to do it:</b>Get in a press-up position, but rest on your forearms rather than your hands. Make sure your back is straight and tense your abs and glutes. Hold without allowing your hips to sag.<br><br>

<b>Why:</b> Endless crunches put pressure on your spine and, when done incorrectly, can give you a set of weird, distended abs. Planks are perfect for working your core in a way that keeps you injury-free and builds the flat six-pack you're after.</p>

  <div class="card-body">
    <h3 class="card-title"> Bench dips</h3><br>
    <p class="card-text"><b>How to do it:</b>Stand facing away from a bench, grab it with both hands at shoulder-width. Extend your legs out in front of you. Slowly lower your body by flexing at the elbows until your arm at forearm create a 90 degree angle. Using your triceps lift yourself back to the starting position.<br><br>

<b>Why:</b> This is easy to do on a chair, stair or coffee table. It works the arms, chest and shoulders and is great if you want people to notice that you've started working out as it builds triceps effectively.</p>

  <div class="card-body">
    <h3 class="card-title"> lower back-curl</h3><br>
    <p class="card-text"><b>How to do it:</b>Lie down flat with your arms by your sides. Slowly raise your chest upwards, with your arms down. Keep your head up during the move. Once you've reached the furthest point up, lower yourself back down.<br><br>

<b>Why:</b> People often forget the importance of back workouts, but they're vital to develop all other muscle groups. This curl is great as it works the whole back and also alleviates back pain from days at the desk.</p>

  <div class="card-body">
    <h3 class="card-title"> two point plank</h3><br>
    <p class="card-text"><b>How to do it:</b>Get in a press-up position, with your hands beneath your shoulders and core locked to ensure a straight line from head to heels. Tense your abs and fight the urge to raise your hips as you lift your left foot and right arm until they're parallel to the ground. Slowly lower and repeat on the opposite side. That's one rep.<br><br>

<b>Why:</b> Finding a plank too easy? Fire-up your core, shoulders and stabilising muscles with this devilish move. It'll test your co-ordination, core strength and more.</p>

  <div class="card-body">
    <h3 class="card-title">Diamend Press up</h3><br>
    <p class="card-text"><b>How to do it:</b>Get in a press-up position and place your hands together so your index fingers and thumbs form a diamond. Keep your back straight as you lower until your chest almost touches the floor then push back up to the start position.<br><br>

<b>Why:</b> If standard press-ups are feeling too easy, try this. It'll smoke your triceps and chest and challenge your form. A tip: Keep your core locked to avoid sagging at the hips and putting stress on the lower back.</p>
