    <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">floor press</h6>
    <p class="card-text">Sets 4 Reps 10 Rest 60sec <br><br>

<b>How</b> Lie flat on the floor, holding a dumbbell in each hand above your chest with straight arms. Lower the weights towards your chest, then press them back up powerfully to return to the start.<br><br>

<b>Why</b> Lying on the floor puts you in a stable position so you can attempt to go quite heavy with this move. The range of motion is shorter than a bench press, so focus on contracting the chest muscles being targeted.</p>

    <h3 class="card-title">Chest And Back</h3>
    <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Bent-over row</h6>
    <p class="card-text">Sets 4 Reps 10 Rest 60sec <br><br>

<b>How</b> Hold a dumbbell in each hand with palms facing each other. Bend forward, hingeing at the hips, then row the weights up to your sides, leading with your elbows. Lower the weights back to the start under control.
<br><br>
<b>Why</b> This move hits the major muscles of your upper back, while your lower back gets worked to keep your torso upright. Using a hammer grip also hits your forearms and improves grip strength.</p>

    <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">biceps curl</h6>
    <p class="card-text">Sets 4 Reps 10 Rest 60sec <br><br>

<b>How</b> Stand with dumbbells by your sides and palms facing forwards. Keeping your elbows tucked in to your sides, curl the weights up, squeezing your biceps at the top. Lower them back to the start.<br><br>

<b>Why</b> It’s the classic biceps lift for good reason: performing this move perfectly is one of the fastest ways to add size to your biceps. Just keep your reps controlled to avoid swinging the dumbbells up and down.</p>

    <h3 class="card-title">Arms</h3>
    <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Hummer curl</h6>
    <p class="card-text">Sets 4 Reps 10 Rest 60sec <br><br>

<b>How</b> Stand tall, holding a dumbbell over your head with one hand and arm straight. Keeping your chest up, lower the weight behind your head, then raise it back to the start. Do all the reps with one arm and then switch and repeat.<br><br>

<b>Why</b> Working one arm at a time allows you to focus on making your triceps work hard to keep the dumbbell under complete control throughout the lift and lower, while your core must be engaged to keep your torso upright.</p>

    <h3 class="card-title">Arms</h3>
    <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">triceps kick-back</h6>
    <p class="card-text">Sets 4 Reps 10 Rest 60sec <br><br>

<b>How</b>  Lean forward from your hips, keeping your back straight and arm bent holding a dumbbell. Raise the weight behind you until your arm is straight, then lower back to the start. Do all the reps on one side, then repeat with the other arm.<br><br>

<b>Why</b> The key to making this an effective triceps-building move is to make sure you fully contract the working muscle as you straighten your arm, and then to lower the dumbbell back to the start position under full control.</p>

    <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Squat</h6>
    <p class="card-text">Sets 4 Reps 10 Rest 60sec <br><br>

<b>How</b>  Stand tall holding a dumbbell in each hand. Keeping your chest up and core braced, squat down as deep as you can. Push back up through your heels to return to the start position.<br><br>

<b>Why</b> It’s the classic lift for building bigger and stronger legs and because it’s a big compound lift that recruits multiple muscle groups, it’s also effective at torching belly fat too.</p>

    <h3 class="card-title">Legs And Abs </h3>
    <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">lunge</h6>
    <p class="card-text">Sets 4 Reps 10 Rest 60sec <br><br>

<b>How</b>  Stand with a dumbbell in each hand. With your chest up and core braced, take a big step forward with one foot until both knees are bent 90°, then push off your front foot to return to the start. Do all the reps with one leg, then switch.<br><br>

<b>Why</b> The lunge provides many of the same benefits as the squat but with even more core-sculpting advantages because your abs must work overtime to keep your body stable as you lower and raise.</p>

    <h3 class="card-title">Legs And Abs </h3>
    <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Chrunch</h6>
    <p class="card-text">Sets 4 Reps 10 Rest 60sec <br><br>

<b>How</b>  Lie flat on the floor, holding a dumbbell across your chest. Engage your abs, then raise your torso off the floor. Squeeze your abs at the top, then lower yourself slowly and under control.<br><br>

<b>Why</b> The crunch is great for developing your upper abs, but only if you do it right. And the added resistance of the dumbbell will force those muscles to up their game to lift and lower your torso without help from momentum.</p>

    <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Overhead press</h6>
    <p class="card-text">Sets 4 Reps 10 Rest 60sec <br><br>

<b>How</b>  Stand tall holding a dumbbell in each hand at shoulder height. Keeping your chest up, press the weights directly overhead until your arms are straight, then lower them back to the start.<br><br>

<b>Why</b> The key to building bigger, wider shoulders is to make these muscles work through their full range of motion, so make sure you lower the dumbbells all the way back to the start position at the end of each rep.</p>

    <p class="card-text">Sets 4 Reps 10 Rest 60sec <br><br>

<b>How</b>  Stand with dumbbells by your sides and palms facing each other. Lean forward slightly, then raise the weights to the sides, leading with your elbows. Slowly lower them back to the start under control.<br><br>

<b>Why</b> This is a fantastic move for hitting your side delts – the section of the shoulder muscles that, when developed, creates a strong and wide upper body to help create the coveted V-shaped torso.</p>
